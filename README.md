## TASK


TRANSACTION FEE CALCULATOR


Consider the scenario where transaction charge for inter-bank transfer varies based on the amount to be transferred as shown below;

Amount Charge
1 - 5000=
10

5001 - 50000=
25

above 50000=
50

A transfer of N4000 will attract a charge of N10 while a transfer of N20000 will attract a charge of N25.

QUESTION:

Write a simple program that reads the fee configuration from a file, accepts an "Amount to be transferred" as input, use the amount configuration in the file to compute the expected charge, and outputs the charge.
